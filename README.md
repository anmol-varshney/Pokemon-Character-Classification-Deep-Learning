# ðŸ˜Ž Deep Learning based Classification of the Pokemon Character by Reducing Dimension
This classification has been conducted on such a dataset. All images have been taken in a particular size. Then to reduce dimensions of the picture model uses the principle component analysis technique. It is necessary to use some preprocess techniques as there are many image preprocessing techniques like image restoration, image editing, wavelet transform, etc, therefore it becomes a little bit difficult to select a particular technique. The model is prepared with the experimental observation at the hidden layers so as to adjust the accuracy and to predict well.
#### About Dataset

Dataset is defined for 150 pokemons like pikachu, charizard, ditto, etc and there are 20-25 images of each pokemon in the dataset. Most (if not all) of the images have relatively high quality (correct labels, centered). The images don't have extremely high resolutions but are centered amazingly.
